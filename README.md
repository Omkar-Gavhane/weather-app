# Weather App

This project is a Weather application developed with React. It fetches weather data from an API and displays it for a given city. It is designed to help users learn API integration and the handling of asynchronous data fetching in React.

The app allows users to:

- **Search for weather** by entering a city name.
- **Display current weather data** such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.

## Key Skills and Concepts Learned:
- API integration using `fetch` to get weather data from the OpenWeather API.
- Using `useState` and `useEffect` for managing and displaying data.
- Handling asynchronous operations with `async/await`.
- Displaying loading states and handling errors (future enhancement).

## Planned Changes:
- **UI Changes**: Improvements in the appâ€™s layout and styling for a better user experience.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for cases such as invalid city names or API failures.

This project is a great starting point for beginners looking to improve their React skills while working with real-world APIs.
